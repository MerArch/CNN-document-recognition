**Introduction**

The automatic classification and labeling of images of documents based on their
content is a real-world problem known as document image classification.
In several sectors, including banking, insurance, healthcare, and government,
where there is an enormous quantity of documents that need to be processed
and handled, AI is clearly needed for document image classification. AI may
assist in optimizing the workflow for document processing and classification,
which can save a lot of time and money while also improving productivity and
reducing errors. As a result, there is a significant need for AI-based document
image classification systems, and this is an important topic for AI research and
development. This section provides an introduction to the project.

**About The Dataset**

The dataset utilised in this study was obtained from Kaggle , entitled ”Real
World Document Collections,” comprising 16 distinct classes with roughly 300
images in .jpg format per class. This dataset is a representative sample of the
RVL-CDIP dataset, which encompasses 4.45 GB of data. To train the CNN
model.

**Project Aim and Objectives**
1. Aim: The comparison of CNN’s document image classification performance to that of traditional Machine Learning classifiers

**Ojectives**
• To preprocess a large and complex image documentation dataset.
1) Achievement: A curated and standardised dataset that can be
used for future research.
• to extract HOG features and train traditional classifiers on the dataset.
2) Achievement: A trained traditional classifier model that can accurately classify the images in the dataset.
• To extract CNN features and train a CNN on the dataset.
3) Achievement: A trained CNN model that can accurately classify
the images in the dataset.
• To compare CNN model and benchmark model for image documentation classification.
4) Achievement: An analysis that provides insights into which method
is better suited for image documentation classification based on
the dataset’s complexity and size.
• To explore the potential of transfer learning by using pre-trained
CNN models for image documentation classification.

5) Achievement: An analysis that explores the effectiveness of transfer learning for image documentation classification and provides
insights into potential improvements to the classification accuracy.
